Hello!

To build, run and generate javaDoc the project:
./buildRunJavaDoc.sh
make sure to run the script in the project folder (group_0508/phase1/)
this should build the project and start the GUI.

if you don't want to use the bash script:
1. create a directory to compile the project to
2. run the command: javac -d <Directory to Compile to>  ./src/*/*.java
replacing the text between the <> with the path to the wanted compile directory.
3. run the command: java -cp <Directory to Compile to> viewer.Viewerto start the project.

Cheers!
