It was great working on this assignment with my group. Everyone did their best to contribute to the project and did
a great job finishing their assigned duties. I was handling the front end bits and pieces of back end as well. In
building the gui Elliot and Jeremy helped me, guided me and did a great job explaining the back end which helped in merging the
back end with front fairly simple.

I was in charge of structuring the model, and implementing it with Jeremy. I wrote the original code for
FileManager, which when the project was restructured most of it was moved to ImageFileManager. After model was for the
most part done, I helped Shlok work on the viewer and controller and helped figure out lambda errors until we made the
switch to using jfxl viewer controller structure. I also worked on the layout of the Viewer and helped debug the model.

My job in this group initially was to work on the back end. Along with my teammate Elliot, we finished the model package,
which contains ImageFile.java, ImageFileManager.java and Tag.Manager.java. We made sure that everything works in a dynamic
fashion rather than simply storing lists of everything. Later into the project, after finishing the back end, we then joined
our teammate Shlok to work on the GUI, which is in the viewer package, containing the Viewer.java and the ViewerController.java.
I was mainly focusing on methods interacting with the backend and the handle methods.
