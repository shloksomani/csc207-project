Some things that still need to get done for the model:
     -ImageFile should be able to return a image of it's associated image file.
     -ImageFileManager should be able to change directories. --Done (Elliot Ford)
Some things that need to be done in general:
     -Create a UML diagram (design.pdf)
     -Create a file with contain a concise and clear set of instructions for how to compile and run your code from the
      command line (help.txt)
     -Create a file where each group member should describe what they contributed to phase 1 in 100 words or less.
