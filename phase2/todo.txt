-----Some things to fix-----
-We don't need to check if a set contains a String (I looked into this and not sure how we were having  (Shadman)
 this problem in the first place)
-the way we're updating the views probably isn't necessary,                                             (Elliot)
 we should try creating a bunch of class level observable lists and see if changing them with the
 program is automatically reflected in the views.
-if you make a selection in treeView that isn't an item on the list it returns null which crashes the   (Shlok)
 program.
-You should be able to move through the items in the tree view and it should update the image editor.   (Shlok)
-If you erase a tag it doesn't update the display correctly.                                            (All)

-----Some things to improve-----
-Currently implementing the Observer, Observable design between TagManager (Observer) and               (Jeremy)
 ImageFile (Observable) for when ImageFile has a tag added to it. We should implement the same design
 (With TagManager as the Observable and ImageFile as the Observer) for when a tag is deleted from
 TagManager.
-We should maintain a global list of tags, this can be accomplished with tagManager having it's own     (Jeremy)
 corresponding log file.
-A lot of the log file stuff could be used with tagManager for the above bullet, we should try breaking (Jeremy)
 out the log code in ImageFile and create a Log class that manages log files.
-Allow switching between items in the TreeView using arrowKeys                                          (Shlok)
-Allow drag & drop to move images around (not sure how this works considering that there's no tree view)
-we should display the absolute path of a file

-----Some features to potentially add-----
-look into adding support for moving photos to facebook/instagram/ssh                                   (All)
-support more than just imageFiles                                                                      (All)
-add the ability to ImageFile to modify *just* the original name of a file                              (Shadman)
-a graph (probably a pie chart) that shows the percentages of the tags used in a folder                 (Elliot)


-----Some things to create-----
-unit test for at least 2 classes (ImageFile and ImageFileManager would be a good two to do)            (Elliot)

There's probably more things to do, but this is a good start


------Just something-------
- update log for TagManager
- getGlobalTags

 -----Things completed-----
 -Created a Log class for all persistent logging.
 -Created an interface Taggable to represent all classes that can be tagged.
 -Created an abstract class AbsTaggableFile to represent all
