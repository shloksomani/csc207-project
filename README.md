# CSC207- Group Course Project

## Team - Shlok Somani, Elliot Ford, Jeremy Yang, Shadman

For the final project, our class was given instructions to build an application that allowed users to 
search for images on their computer and "tag" them by editing the filename to include "@tag". This allows 
users to then search for files using their OS's search feature by the tag. Additional unique features for 
our group include a log file for each image tag change.
